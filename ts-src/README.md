A lightweight terminal coding assistant for local development workflows.

MiniCode provides Claude Code-like workflow and architectural ideas in a much smaller implementation, making it especially useful for learning, experimentation, and custom tooling.

## Overview

MiniCode is built around a practical terminal-first agent loop:

- accept a user request
- inspect the workspace
- call tools when needed
- review file changes before writing
- return a final response in the same terminal session

The project is intentionally compact, so the control flow, tool model, and TUI behavior remain easy to understand and extend.

## Why MiniCode

MiniCode is a good fit if you want:

- a lightweight coding assistant instead of a large platform
- a terminal UI with tool calling, transcript, and command workflow
- a small codebase that is suitable for study and modification
- a reference implementation for Claude Code-like agent architecture

## Features

### Core workflow

- multi-step tool execution in a single turn
- model -> tool -> model loop
- full-screen terminal interface
- input history, transcript scrolling, and slash command menu
- discoverable local skills via `SKILL.md`
- dynamic MCP tool loading over stdio
- MCP resources and prompts via generic MCP helper tools

### Built-in tools

- `list_files`
- `grep_files`
- `read_file`
- `write_file`
- `edit_file`
- `patch_file`
- `modify_file`
- `run_command`
- `web_fetch`
- `web_search`
- `ask_user`
- `load_skill`
- `list_mcp_resources`
- `read_mcp_resource`
- `list_mcp_prompts`
- `get_mcp_prompt`

### Safety and usability

- review-before-write flow for file modifications
- path and command permission checks
- local installer with independent config storage
- support for Anthropic-style API endpoints

### Recent interaction upgrades

- approval prompts now use Up/Down selection with Enter confirm
- approval prompts also support direct letter/number shortcuts shown in each option
- supports "reject with guidance" to send corrective instructions back to the model
- edit approvals support "allow this file for this turn" and "allow all edits for this turn"
- file review now uses standard unified diff output (closer to `git diff`)
- approval view supports `Ctrl+O` expand/collapse plus wheel/page scrolling
- `Ctrl+C` now exits cleanly even when an approval prompt is open
- finished tool calls auto-collapse into concise summaries to reduce transcript noise
- explicit background shell commands launched through `run_command` are now surfaced as lightweight shell tasks instead of remaining stuck as a forever-running tool call
- TTY input handling is serialized, and CRLF Enter sequences are normalized so approval confirms do not accidentally fire twice
- fixed an input-event deadlock where approval prompts could stop accepting Up/Down/Enter
- escape-sequence parsing is hardened so malformed terminal input does not stall key handling
- `run_command` now accepts single-string invocations like `"git status"` and auto-splits args
- clarifying questions are now structured via `ask_user`, and the turn pauses until the user replies

## Installation

```bash
cd mini-code
npm install
npm run install-local
```

The installer will ask for:

- model name
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`

Configuration is stored in:

- `~/.mini-code/settings.json`
- `~/.mini-code/mcp.json`

The launcher is installed to:

- `~/.local/bin/minicode`

If `~/.local/bin` is not already on your `PATH`, add:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Quick Start

Run the installed launcher:

```bash
minicode
```

Run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run in offline demo mode:

```bash
MINI_CODE_MODEL_MODE=mock npm run dev
```

## Commands

### Management commands

- `minicode mcp list`
- `minicode mcp add <name> [--project] [--protocol <mode>] [--url <endpoint>] [--header KEY=VALUE ...] [--env KEY=VALUE ...] [-- <command> [args...]]`
- `minicode mcp login <name> --token <bearer-token>`
- `minicode mcp logout <name>`
- `minicode mcp remove <name> [--project]`
- `minicode skills list`
- `minicode skills add <path> [--name <name>] [--project]`
- `minicode skills remove <name> [--project]`

### Local slash commands

- `/help`
- `/tools`
- `/skills`
- `/mcp`
- `/status`
- `/model`
- `/model <name>`
- `/config-paths`

### Terminal interaction

- command suggestions and slash menu
- transcript scrolling
- prompt editing
- input history navigation
- approval selection and feedback input flow (Up/Down + Enter, or key shortcuts)

## Configuration

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "model": "your-model-name",
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
    },
    "remote-example": {
      "protocol": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-token"
      }
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.anthropic.com",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-token",
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "your-model-name"
  }
}
```

Project-scoped MCP config is also supported through Claude Code compatible `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
    }
  }
}
```

For vendor compatibility, MiniCode now auto-negotiates stdio framing:

- standard MCP `Content-Length` framing is tried first
- if that fails, MiniCode falls back to newline-delimited JSON
- you can force a mode per server with `"protocol": "content-length"` or `"protocol": "newline-json"`
- for remote MCP over HTTP, use `"protocol": "streamable-http"` with `"url"` (and optional `"headers"`)
- header values support environment interpolation, e.g. `"Authorization": "Bearer $MCP_TOKEN"`

Remote MCP authentication strategy (lightweight by design):

- use `minicode mcp login <name> --token <bearer-token>` to store a bearer token locally
- use `minicode mcp logout <name>` to clear a stored token
- for now, MiniCode intentionally uses this token-based path instead of a full built-in OAuth callback + refresh state machine
- this keeps the implementation small and aligned with MiniCode's lightweight architecture goals; full OAuth automation may be added later when needed

Skills are discovered from:

- `./.mini-code/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `~/.mini-code/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `./.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Configuration priority:

1. `~/.mini-code/settings.json`
2. `~/.mini-code/mcp.json`
3. project `.mcp.json`
4. compatible existing local settings
5. process environment variables

## Skills and MCP Usage

MiniCode supports two extension layers:

- `skills`: local workflow instructions, usually described by a `SKILL.md`
- `MCP`: external tool providers that expose tools, resources, and prompts into MiniCode

### Skills: install, inspect, trigger

Install a local skill:

```bash
minicode skills add ~/minimax-skills/skills/frontend-dev --name frontend-dev
```

List installed or discovered skills:

```bash
minicode skills list
```

Inside the interactive UI, you can also run:

```text
/skills
```

to inspect which skills are available in the current session.

If you explicitly mention a skill name, MiniCode will prefer loading it. For example:

```text
Use the frontend-dev skill and directly rebuild the current landing page instead of stopping at a plan.
```

If you want to be even more explicit:

```text
Load the fullstack-dev skill first, then follow its workflow to implement this task.
```

A common pattern is to clone an official or Claude Code-compatible skills repo locally and install from there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/skills.git ~/minimax-skills
minicode skills add ~/minimax-skills/skills/frontend-dev --name frontend-dev
```

### MCP: install, inspect, trigger

Install a user-scoped MCP server:

```bash
minicode mcp add MiniMax --env MINIMAX_API_KEY=your-key --env MINIMAX_API_HOST=https://api.minimaxi.com -- uvx minimax-coding-plan-mcp -y
```

List configured MCP servers:

```bash
minicode mcp list
```

To configure an MCP server only for the current project, add `--project`:

```bash
minicode mcp add filesystem --project -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .
minicode mcp list --project
```

Inside the interactive UI, run:

```text
/mcp
```

to see which servers are connected, which protocol they negotiated, and how many tools / resources / prompts they expose.

MCP tools are automatically registered as:

```text
mcp__<server_name>__<tool_name>
```

For example, after connecting the MiniMax MCP server you may see:

- `mcp__minimax__web_search`
- `mcp__minimax__understand_image`

These tool names are not hand-written in MiniCode. They appear automatically after a successful MCP connection.

### How to use them in chat

The simplest approach is to just describe the task naturally and let the model decide when to use a skill or MCP tool:

```text
Search for recent Chinese-language resources about MCP and give me 5 representative links.
```

If MiniMax MCP is connected, the model will typically choose `mcp__minimax__web_search`.

If you want a more controlled workflow, name the skill or target capability explicitly:

```text
Use the frontend-dev skill and directly modify the current project files to turn this page into a more complete product landing page.
```

Or:

```text
Use the connected MCP tools to search for the MiniMax MCP guide and summarize what capabilities it provides.
```

### When to use skills vs MCP

- `skills` are better for workflow, conventions, domain-specific instructions, and reusable execution patterns
- `MCP` is better for search, image understanding, browsers, filesystems, databases, and other remote capabilities

A common combination is:

- use a skill such as `frontend-dev` to shape how the work should be done
- use MCP to provide external search, image understanding, or system integrations

### Compatibility notes

MiniCode currently focuses on:

- local `SKILL.md` discovery with `load_skill`
- stdio MCP servers
- MCP tools
- generic helper tools for MCP resources and prompts

For vendor compatibility, MiniCode automatically tries:

- standard `Content-Length` framing
- then falls back to `newline-json` if needed

That means servers such as MiniMax MCP, which use newline-delimited JSON over stdio, can still be connected directly.
