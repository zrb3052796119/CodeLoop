    return """## Engineering Governance Rules (MANDATORY)

These rules apply to ALL code you write. No exceptions.

### Iron Laws
1. **Theory first**: Read theory before any engineering activity
2. **Requirements first**: No code without design, no design without requirements
3. **1:1 binding**: Requirements and knowledge always appear in pairs
4. **Design-driven**: Code implements design, not independent creation
5. **Audit loop**: Execute audit after each phase, fail → fix → re-audit
6. **Single sink**: business/src/ must have exactly ONE sink file
7. **One-way dependencies**: All dependency flow is unidirectional, zero cycles
8. **No skipping**: Each phase's exit signals must be met before next phase

### Package Structure (Six Areas)
Every package must have:
- `port/port_entry/` — Entry points (can import anything)
- `wrap/src/` — External library adapters (import: port_entry, wrap/config, wrap/src)
- `business/src/` — Business logic (import: wrap sinks, business/config, business/src)
- `test/src/` — Tests (import: business/src, test/config, test/src)
- `business/config/` — Business config (zero dependencies)
- `wrap/config/` — Adapter config (zero dependencies)
- `test/config/` — Test config (zero dependencies)

### Dependency Direction Rules
- `business/src/` → `wrap/src/` sinks → `port/port_entry/` → `vendor/`
- `business/src/` CANNOT import vendor/, external libs directly
- `wrap/src/` CANNOT import business/src/
- Config imports always come LAST in import statements
- Cross-package: port_exit → port_entry (same language to same language)

### Sink Rule
- `business/src/`: EXACTLY ONE sink (file not imported by other business/src/ files)
- `wrap/src/`: Can have multiple sinks (each must be used by business/src/)
- `test/src/`: Can have multiple sinks (all must be used by port_exit)
- Multiple sinks in business/src/ = MUST split package

### Documentation System
- Requirements → Knowledge → Design → Code (strict one-way flow)
- Each requirement scenario has exactly one matching knowledge file (1:1 path mirror)
- Each design file cites: satisfied requirements, depended knowledge
- Code file paths must be isomorphic to design file paths

### Import Sorting Example
```python
# Non-config imports first
from package.wrap/src/adapter import Adapter
from package.business/src/service import Service

# Config imports LAST
from package.business/config import settings
```

### Audit Checklist (Execute After Code Changes)
Audit 0: Knowledge ↔ Requirements 1:1
Audit 1: Design ← Requirements + Knowledge coverage
Audit 2: Code ← Design isomorphism + Dependency compliance
Audit 3: business/src/ single sink + Package DAG

### Boundary Packaging (Legacy Code)
- When introducing legacy code: only through port_entry → wrap/src/ ([LEGACY] tag)
- Each [LEGACY] file must have expected cleanup date
- Legacy code can reference governance area via port_exit directly

### Repository Rules
- ZERO compositional dependencies between repositories
- Cross-repository needs: copy to local vendor/
- Vendor only imported by port_entry/"""
